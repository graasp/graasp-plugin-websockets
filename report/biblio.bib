      abstract = {Nowadays, students bring their full ecosystem of social  media platforms and their own devices to school, while  teachers benefit from and contribute to local or global  repositories of educational resources. As a consequence,  educational institutions have to better align their digital  infrastructures and support schemes with these personal  ecosystems and social practices. They also have to offer  resources at a level of granularity aligned with targeted  activities rather than full-fledged courses to ease  personalization. Institutions finally have to ensure  control of learning traces and persistence of learning  outcome. To meet these needs, this paper presents  Graasp.eu, a social media platform supporting digital  education from primary and secondary school to higher  education. Participatory design, fitness for active  learning, and adoption are discussed as well},

	abstract =	{The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code. The security model used for this is the origin-based security model commonly used by web browsers. The protocol consists of an opening handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP. The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need two-way communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g., using XMLHttpRequest or \textless{}iframe\textgreater{}s and long polling). {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
